title: Apple Warranty Overview
---
Apple Warranty refers to the process of estimating the warranty expiry dates for Apple devices. This estimation is necessary because Apple does not provide an API for exact warranty information.

The estimation process uses a predefined set of manufacture date ranges based on the serial number of the device. These ranges provide an estimated start and end date for the warranty.

## Supported Manufacturers

Apple is listed as one of the supported manufacturers, but it uses estimated dates for warranty information.

## Apple Note

Due to changes in how Apple generates serial numbers, it is challenging to determine accurate warranty expiry dates for newer devices. As a result, the estimated dates might be inaccurate.

To avoid updating systems with potentially incorrect data, users can use the `-ExcludeApple` switch in the `Update-Warrantyinfo.ps1` script to skip updating warranty information for Apple devices.

The function <SwmToken path="/private/Get-AppleWarranty.ps1" pos="1:2:4" line-data="function get-AppleWarranty([Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]$SourceDevice, $Client) {" repo-id="Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBUG93ZXJTaGVsbFdhcnJhbnR5UmVwb3J0cyUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=" repo-name="PowerShellWarrantyReports">`get-AppleWarranty`</SwmToken> is responsible for generating these estimated warranty dates. It creates a custom object with the estimated start and end dates based on the device's serial number.

If the `-ExcludeApple` switch is not used, the function returns an object with the estimated warranty information. Otherwise, it returns an object indicating that warranty information could not be retrieved.

```powershell
